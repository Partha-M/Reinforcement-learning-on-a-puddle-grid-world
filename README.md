# Reinforcement learning on a puddle grid world
Implementation and comparison of Q-learning, SARSA and SARSA($\lambda$) using python and OpenAI Gym to reach different goals in a puddle grid world with 4 stochastic actions in the presence of a gentle Westerly blowing.

If there is problem is running for the environment then use the command  pip install -e .
to install the environment.
For MATLAB plot rename the datafile as the loading files.
Rollout function file is for visualisation of optimal trajectories.

MATLAB files are named according to the plot they produced.

Extra Q SARSA and SARSA lambda python files are for plotting steps
and reward against alpha and lambda values.
